# Terraform-AWS-projects

This Repo will contain several terraform aws projects for those looking to build a terraform project portfolio

1. [Task 1: encrpyting s3 events sent to sns topic](https://github.com/Frankpromise/Terraform-AWS-projects/tree/master/sns-topic) 

configure s3 events to be sent to an SNS topic. This way, the topic is able to publish the message to several endpoints like HTTPS, Lambda, Email and so on.

‚úÖIts also not enough to publish the notifications, You should also consider adding a layer of security. To achieve this:

üëâüèª AWS has a server side encryption(SSE) for SNS which when enabled, is able to publish messages in an encrypted mode and its only decrypted when delivered to the endpoint.

In my example  I created a KMS key which is used to encrypt and decrypt the message, and also attached a policy that allows an account owner to administrate the key and allow the bucket to use it.


2. [Task 2: Host a static website on s3 using CDN and Route53](https://github.com/Frankpromise/Terraform-AWS-projects/tree/master/cdn-s3)
